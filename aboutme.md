Welcome to my blog.
- I'm Duy-Thuc Le, a 19 year-old boy.
- I'm studing Computer Science major at HCM University of Science
- I'm addicted to competitive programming
### What is the purpose of this blog?
- I'll learn to write in this blog. 
- I'll talk about me, about what I like, maybe it is a song, a problem or whaterver I want. Maybe I'll publish some solutions that I think it's funny.
